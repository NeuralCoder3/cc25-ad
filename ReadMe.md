# Artifacts for MimIrADe: Automatic Differentiation in MimIR

We present the code to replicate the experiments from the paper "MimIrADe: Automatic Differentiation in MimIR" submitted at the "International Conference on Compiler Construction" (CC) 2025.

To run, execute `evaluate.sh` on a linux.
This script will call the necessary other scripts.
For our experiments, we use Docker, to make replicating the results easier.

The results will be placed in `./output`.
